Bhavya's Fitness Website
This project is a simple, responsive fitness website for Bhavya Fitness, designed to provide users with essential information about the gym and offer a form for joining. The website features a clean layout with a welcoming background image and a user-friendly form.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is built to adjust smoothly across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Navigation Menu: A navigation bar allows easy access to sections like Home, About Us, Fitness Calculator, and Contact Us.
Custom Font: The site uses the "Baloo Bhai 2" font from Google Fonts, giving it a modern and approachable look.
Interactive Form: Users can submit their information (Name, Age, Gender, and Place) through a simple form for membership inquiries.
Technologies
The project is primarily developed using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling. The layout incorporates CSS properties such as positioning, font settings, and background images. The use of Google Fonts enhances typography, while hover effects provide interactive feedback for buttons and navigation links.

Potential Improvements
Future enhancements could include building out the "Fitness Calculator" page to provide personalized fitness advice, adding client-side validation for the form, and optimizing the site for even better performance on mobile devices.

This project serves as a minimal, functional fitness site that can be easily extended for more complex features and a better user experience.
